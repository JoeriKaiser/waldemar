  <summary>More About My Journey</summary>
  <div class="details-content">

Born in the Netherlands, I moved to France at a young age with my family. Growing up, I gladly followed the family tradition and enrolled in catering school. My early career began in hospitality, first working as a waiter, and eventually becoming a passionate bartender and even trying some mixology. It taught me a lot about adaptability and working under pressure – skills I still use today.

But even while I was pouring drinks and serving tables, my true passion was elsewhere: coding. I spent my spare time tinkering with WordPress sites for acquaintances and exploring Minecraft plugins, booting up the PC whenever I could. When the pandemic hit, it felt like the right time for a change (I wasn't the only one !). That's when I decided to fully pursue what I had been doing on the side for years.

I enrolled in several courses on Udemy and later joined a coding bootcamp in my local city, sharpening my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and discovering new things i didn't even know existed. I felt overwhelmed but still curious at the challenge, By 2022, I had landed my first internship as a web developer. A year later, I was thrilled to be hired full-time by the same company.

Now, I'm continuing to grow my skills, staying curious, and pushing the boundaries of what I can do as a developer. Whether it's building interfaces or back-end solutions, I'm excited making the web more alive.
