A fish shell plugin that logs command history with directory context and provides project-scoped history search via fzf. Designed to complement [fzf.fish](https://github.com/PatrickF1/fzf.fish).

The plugin tracks which directory each command was run in, allowing you to search history scoped to your current project. No more sifting through unrelated commands from other directories.
