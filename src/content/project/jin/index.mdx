Built for [Theo Browne's](https://t3.gg/) T3 Cloneathon, Jin is my spin on an LLM chat app where you can chat with different AI models. 10 days to clone T3 Chat - talk about a sprint!

Frontend uses [SolidJS](https://solidjs.com) with [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com), while the backend runs on [Go](https://golang.org) with [Gin](https://gin-gonic.com) and [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org). WebSockets keeps the sync between clients in real-time.

This hackathon was a fun challenge that pushed me to build fast and make quick decisions. Everything's containerized with [Docker](https://docker.com)

Want to check it out?
