As someone who's spent countless hours enjoying this timeless puzzle game, I set out to create my own take on the beloved classic.

Built with [Tauri](https://tauri.app) and [React](https://react.dev), this project also includes 3D visuals powered by [Three.js](https://threejs.org).

This game was built to further develop my skills with Three.js and building desktop apps with Tauri.

While the core game is ready, exciting new features are on the roadmap.
