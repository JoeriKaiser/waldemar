FBench started as a learning project to dive deeper into [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) and [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui). I wanted a simple, lightweight database explorer that wouldn't feel slow on large datasets

Features a schema browser with row estimates, syntax-highlighted query editor with autocomplete, sortable results with export to CSV/JSON/XML, and support for both [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org) and [MySQL](https://mysql.com) which are the main 2 I use.

The async architecture keeps the UI snappy while [SQLx](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx) handles queries on a background [Tokio](https://tokio.rs) runtime - no freezing when running heavy queries.
