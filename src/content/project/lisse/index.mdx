Lisse is a passion project that I started in 2024 and am currently working on.
It's a middleman code scanner for users to be able to scan their code and forward to a third party.
If you want to follow the project or check it out, you can find the repo here: [Lisse](https://github.com/JoeriKaiser/lisse)
