          My journey into tech might not be the most conventional, but it's been a path of growth,
          curiosity, and persistence.

          <summary>More About My Journey</summary>
          <div class="details-content">
            <p>
              Born in the Netherlands, I moved to France at a young age with my family. Growing up,
              I gladly followed the family tradition and enrolled in catering school. My early
              career began in hospitality, first working as a waiter, and eventually becoming a
              passionate bartender and even trying some mixology. It taught me a lot about
              adaptability and working under pressure – skills I still use today.
            </p>
            <p>
              But even while I was pouring drinks and serving tables, my true passion was elsewhere:
              coding. I spent my spare time tinkering with WordPress sites for acquaintances and
              exploring Minecraft plugins, booting up the PC whenever I could. When the pandemic
              hit, it felt like the right time for a change (I wasn't the only one!). That's when I
              decided to fully pursue what I had been doing on the side for years.
            </p>
            <p>
              I enrolled in several courses on Udemy and later joined a coding bootcamp in my local
              city, sharpening my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and discovering new things I
              didn't even know existed. I felt overwhelmed but still curious at the challenge. By
              2022, I had landed my first internship as a web developer. A year later, I was
              thrilled to be hired full-time by the same company.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, I'm continuing to grow my skills, staying curious, and pushing the boundaries of
              what I can do as a developer. Whether it's building interfaces or back-end solutions,
              I'm excited making the web more alive.
